        <h3>GENERAL TERMS</h3>
        <p>If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Agreement will be construed consistent
          with applicable law. The remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Any failure on the part of the
          Company to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of our right to enforce such
          provision. Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement. You agree that any cause
          of action related to or arising out of your relationship with the Company must commence within ONE year after the
          cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.</p>
        <p>These Terms of Use and your use of the Site are governed by the federal laws of the United States of America and
          the laws of the State of Virginia, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>
        <p>The Company may assign or delegate these Terms of Service and/or the Company’s Privacy Policy, in whole or in part,

          obligations under the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy without the Company’s prior written consent, and any unauthorized
          assignment and delegation by you is void.</p>
