        <p>
          Chaperone (the “Company”) is committed to maintaining robust privacy protections for its users. Our Privacy Policy (“Privacy
          Policy”) is designed to help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard the information you provide to us
          and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          For purposes of this Agreement, “Service” refers to the Company’s service which can be accessed via at www.getchaperone.com
          or through our extension in which users can create online interactive tutorials.
        </p>
        <p>
          The terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the Company. “You” refers to you, as a user of Service. By accepting our Privacy
          Policy and Terms of Use, you consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information
          as described in this Privacy.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="pt-5">
        <h3>I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
        <p>We collect “Non-Personal Information” and “Personal Information.” Non-Personal Information includes information that
          cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage data, general demographic information we may
          collect, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, preferences you submit and preferences that are generated
          based on the data you submit and number of clicks. Personal Information includes only your email, which you submit
          to us through the registration process at the Site.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pt-3">
        <h4>1- Information collected via Technology</h4>
        <p>
          To activate the Service you do not need to submit any Personal Information other than your email address. To use the Service
          thereafter, you do not need to submit further Personal Information. However, in an effort to improve the quality
          of the Service, we track information provided to us by your browser or by our software application when you view
          or use the Service, such as the website you came from (known as the “referring URL”), the device from which you
          connected to the Service, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify
          you. We track this information using cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier.
          Cookies are sent to a user’s browser from our servers and are stored on the user’s computer hard drive. Sending
          a cookie to a user’s browser enables us to collect Non-Personal information about that user and keep a record of
          the user’s preferences when utilizing our services, both on an individual and aggregate basis. For example, the
          Company may use cookies to collect the following information:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>language preference</li>
          <li>referring site</li>
          <li>date and time of website visit</li>
          <li>IP address</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Company may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close
          your session and until you delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser. You can configure
          your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from any website you visit. If
          you do this, it’s possible that Chaperone might not work as well.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pt-3">
        <h4>2- Information you provide us by registering for an account</h4>
        <p>In addition to the information provided automatically by your browser when you visit the Site, to become a subscriber
          to the Service you will need to create a personal profile. You can create a profile by registering with the Service
          and entering your email address, and creating a user name and a password. By registering, you are authorizing us
          to collect, store and use your email address in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pt-5">
        <h3>II. HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION</h3>
        <h4>Personal Information:</h4>
        <p>Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share for marketing purposes
          your Personal Information with third parties without your consent. We do share Personal Information with vendors
          who are performing services for the Company, such as the servers for our email communications who are provided
          access to user’s email address for purposes of sending emails from us. Those vendors use your Personal Information
          only at our direction and in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>In general, the Personal Information you provide to us is used to help us communicate with you. For example, we use
          Personal Information to contact users in response to questions, solicit feedback from users, provide technical
          support, and inform users about promotional offers.</p>
        <p>Non-Personal Information</p>
        <p>In general, we use Non-Personal Information to help us improve the Service and customize the user experience. We
          also aggregate Non-Personal Information in order to track trends and analyze use patterns on the Site. This Privacy
          Policy does not limit in any way our use or disclosure of Non-Personal Information and we reserve the right to
          use and disclose such Non-Personal Information to our partners, advertisers and other third parties at our discretion.</p>
        <p>In the event we undergo a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or
          a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge and consent
          that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of our assets may
          continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If our information practices
          change at any time in the future, we will post the policy changes to the Site so that you may opt out of the new
          information practices. We suggest that you check the Site periodically if you are concerned about how your information
          is used.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pt-5">
        <h3>III. HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>We implement security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. Your account is protected
          by your account password and we urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe by not disclosing
          your password and by logging out of your account after each use. We further protect your information from potential
          security breaches by implementing certain technological security measures including encryption, firewalls and secure
          socket layer technology. However, these measures do not guarantee that your information will not be accessed, disclosed,
          altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. By using our Service, you acknowledge
          that you understand and agree to assume these risks.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pt-5">
        <h3>IV. YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>You have the right at any time to prevent us from contacting you for marketing purposes. When we send a promotional
          communication to a user, the user can opt out of further promotional communications by following the unsubscribe
          instructions provided in each promotional e-mail. You can also indicate that you do not wish to receive marketing
          communications from us in the “Settings” section of the Site. Please note that notwithstanding the promotional
          preferences you indicate by either unsubscribing or opting out in the Settings section of the Site, we may continue
          to send you administrative emails including, for example, periodic updates to our Privacy Policy.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pt-5">
        <h3>V. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</h3>
        <p>As part of the Service, we may provide links to or compatibility with other websites or applications. However, we
          are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by those websites or the information or content they contain.
          This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Site and the Service. Therefore,
          this Privacy Policy does not apply to your use of a third party website accessed by selecting a link on our Site
          or via our Service. To the extent that you access or use the Service through or on another website or application,
          then the privacy policy of that other website or application will apply to your access or use of that site or application.
          We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of other websites before proceeding to use them.</p>
